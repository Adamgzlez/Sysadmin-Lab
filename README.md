# Sysadmin Lab

## Objective

The Sysadmin Lab is aimed to establish a new server to replace a malfunctioning Linux server. The primary focus was to check user permissions on sensitive files, create user accounts, create a user group and collaborative folder, using lynis to audit the new server, and install chkrootkit to search for any potential rootkits that may have been installed. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, creating and modifying a new server, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Create and assign users for services.
- Auditing the services being ran on the server.
- Analyzing permissions on sensitive files and changing permission if needed.
- Making group folders and assigning users

### Tools Used

- Local virtual machine.
- Lynis package.
- chkrootkit package.
- Virtual box/Ubuntu VM.
